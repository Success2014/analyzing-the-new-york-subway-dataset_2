def plot_weather_data(turnstile_weather):
    ''' 
    plot_weather_data is passed a dataframe called turnstile_weather. 
    Use turnstile_weather along with ggplot to make another data visualization
    focused on the MTA and weather data we used in Project 3.
    
    Make a type of visualization different than what you did in the previous exercise.
    Try to use the data in a different way (e.g., if you made a lineplot concerning 
    ridership and time of day in exercise #1, maybe look at weather and try to make a 
    histogram in this exercise). Or try to use multiple encodings in your graph if 
    you didn't in the previous exercise.
    
    You should feel free to implement something that we discussed in class 
    (e.g., scatterplots, line plots, or histograms) or attempt to implement
    something more advanced if you'd like.

    Here are some suggestions for things to investigate and illustrate:
     * Ridership by time-of-day or day-of-week
     * How ridership varies by subway station
     * Which stations have more exits or entries at different times of day
       (You can use UNIT as a proxy for subway station.)

    If you'd like to learn more about ggplot and its capabilities, take
    a look at the documentation at:
    https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ggplot/
     
    You can check out the link 
    https://www.dropbox.com/s/meyki2wl9xfa7yk/turnstile_data_master_with_weather.csv
    to see all the columns and data points included in the turnstile_weather 
    dataframe.
     
   However, due to the limitation of our Amazon EC2 server, we are giving you a random
    subset, about 1/3 of the actual data in the turnstile_weather dataframe.

    In exercise 5, we calculated the R^2 value for you. But why don't you try and
    and calculate the R^2 value yourself.
    
    Given a list of original data points, and also a list of predicted data points,
    write a function that will compute and return the coefficient of determination (R^2)
    for this data.  numpy.mean() and numpy.sum() might both be useful here, but
    not necessary.

    per hour for our data, why don't you make a histogram of the residuals
    (that is, the difference between the original hourly entry data and the predicted values).
    Try different binwidths for your histogram.

    Based on this residual histogram, do you have any insight into how our model
    performed?  Reading a bit on this webpage might be useful:

def predictions(dataframe):
    '''
    The NYC turnstile data is stored in a pandas dataframe called weather_turnstile.
    Using the information stored in the dataframe, let's predict the ridership of
    the NYC subway using linear regression with gradient descent.
    
    You can download the complete turnstile weather dataframe here:
    https://www.dropbox.com/s/meyki2wl9xfa7yk/turnstile_data_master_with_weather.csv    
    
    Your prediction should have a R^2 value of 0.20 or better.
    You need to experiment using various input features contained in the dataframe. 
    We recommend that you don't use the EXITSn_hourly feature as an input to the 
    linear model because we cannot use it as a predictor: we cannot use exits 
    counts as a way to predict entry counts. 
    
    Note: Due to the memory and CPU limitation of our Amazon EC2 instance, we will
    give you a random subet (~15%) of the data contained in 
    turnstile_data_master_with_weather.csv. You are encouraged to experiment with 
    this computer on your own computer, locally. 
    
    
    If you'd like to view a plot of your cost history, uncomment the call to 
    plot_cost_history below. The slowdown from plotting is significant, so if you 
    are timing out, the first thing to do is to comment out the plot command again.
    
    If you receive a "server has encountered an error" message, that means you are 
    hitting the 30-second limit that's placed on running your program. Try using a 
    smaller number for num_iterations if that's the case.
    
    If you are using your own algorithm/models, see if you can optimize your code so 
    that it runs faster.
